Description: # Use fourier transform to draw epicycles with your drawings.
        
        Draw a picture or sample one, press space, then watch an epic simulation of epicycles being drawned identically as your picture. Thanks the the fourier transform your drawing will be reproduced in a real-time simulation only using epicycles.
        
        # Install
        
        ```bash
        #Clone the repository
        git clone git@github.com:MarcPartensky/Fourier.git
        cd Fourier
        
        #Install requirements
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        
        #Go to source folder [Do NOT forget this step]
        cd src
        ```
        
        # Start
        
        Put your model image `image.png` in the `FourierImages` folder.
        
        * Option 1: Give image at launch.
        
        ```bash
        python fourier.py image.png
        ```
        
        * Option 2: Launch then give the image.
        
        ```bash
        python fourier.py
        > image name:
        ```
        
        Then give your image:
        
        ```bash
        > image name:image.png
        ```
        
        # Description
        
        There are 3 modes in this program:
        
        * Mode 1: Sampling
        Sample or draw a picture.
        
        * Mode 2: Drawing
        Watch the epicycles simulation which uses fourier transform.
        
        * Mode 3: Display
        Get the output image directly without waiting for the simulation.
        
        # Controls
        
        * Space: Switch to next mode.
        * Enter: Go back to the center.
        * Up/Down/Right/Left Arrow: Move arround.
        * Right/Left Shift: Zoom in or out.
        * Quit/Escape: Quit.
        * Z: Cancel last sample.
        * R: Remove all samples.
        * S: Save the fourier-coefficients.
